Okay Folks ...

For 31 August 2018, pls make sure you have downloaded Git for Windows and created Github account.

Then create a directory in your laptop with sone meaningful name (I suggest CSH1F2_yourstudentid).

Change to this directory and issue git init command.

Then try to familiarize yourself with Git. 
There are many quick introduction videos out there like this one ( dont think bad about their name ?? ):

Book by git-scm.com is also a good place to start:

At a glance, I will be delivering Algoritm Intro tomorrow for around 30 mins and then ask you to download something from git, then submit your class project through git DVCS as well.
