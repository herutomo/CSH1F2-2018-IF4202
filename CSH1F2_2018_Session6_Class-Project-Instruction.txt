Subject:	CSH1F2
Subject Name:	Introduction to Computer Science
Topic:		Session 6
Theme:		Class Project



Instruction:

This session (Week 6) we wil try to see an implementation of data visualization (data representation) in the area of Smart Cities.

You are free to choose and use other materials for comparison and learning improvement.

We will use and embrace the media below:
	Python as our language technology (view only)
	Kagggle.com as code sharing 


The class project below will typically take around 15 to 45 minutes end to end, 

please make sure you are running on a computer with minimal background processes and sufficient RAM (4GB with small number of background processes in Windows 10 Operating System) and CPU (Intel Core i5 or better), because the notebook sometimes could cause your CPU fan to swirl fast.

Lets move it on:


1 Prepare your local repository:

	1a Enter the branch that you created in Session 2 by entering the folder in your computer and do : git checkout <your_student_id>
		attention: 
		please use the directory / folder that you have been working on since Session 2.
		if you use a new directory or folder or new computer, you have to follow the Git initiation and related process before you start working, and I dont cover the related support in this session.

	1b Do the following in your working branch inside your local repository from Session 2 : git pull origin master 

		
2 Follow the instruction below: 

	2a open https://www.kaggle.com/wti200/exploratory-analysis-nyc-taxi-trip
		it is an example of how citizen or public can dig down into exploration of city taxi trips, in this case New York City taxi.

	2b try to analyze graphs in "Feature Visualization" and "Feature Engineering" sections.
	
	2c answer questions below in this file and submit maximum by 21.00 (09.00 PM) UTC+07.00 at 03 October 2018 (today, in 1 hour):

	2d submit by issueing: git push origin <your_student_id>

	2e Back to master branch in local repository to make sure you will be ready like a bread fresh from the oven: git checkout master

Answer for	: What do you think the meaning of "Feature " in this notebook ? 		(20 to 40 words)	(20 points)

		 think the feature in this notebook makes it easy for us to calculate data analysis with visualization features by using Python on the duration of the trip and in this second feature for count speed of taxi

Answer for	: What do you see in the relation between trip and time in this notebook ? 	(40 to 100 words)	(40 points)

		relation between trip and time show that more time we have also more trip we have. Because distance of trip and time suitable of the law. NYC gets more visitors when NYC is warm, Trip time increases gradually over time.

Answer for	: Search Google, what are different types of data analysis ? 			(40 to 100 words)	(40 points)
		Descriptive analytics. Descriptive analytics answers the question of what happened. ...
    		Diagnostic analytics. At this stage, historical data can be measured against other data to answer the question of why something happened. ...
    		Predictive analytics. Predictive analytics tells what is likely to happen. ...
    		Prescriptive analytics.
