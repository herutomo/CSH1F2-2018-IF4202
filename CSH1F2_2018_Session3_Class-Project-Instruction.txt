Term:		2018/2019
Subject:	CSH1F2
Subject Name:	Introduction to Computer Science
Topic:		Session 3
Theme:		Class Project


Instruction:

We will understand algorithms by just sorting out simple puzzle containing pieces of code.
When ordered properly, you can see a working Ping Pong game with 1 player.

So lets start it up :

1 Upload .sb2 file to https://scratch.mit.edu:

	1a There will be 2 new files:
		CSH1F2_2018_Session3_Class-Project-Instruction.txt
		CSH1F2_2018_Session3_Class-Project.sb2
	1b Enter the branch that you created in Session 2 by doing : git checkout <your_student_id>
	1c Do the following in your working branch inside your local repository from Session 2 : git pull origin master 
	1d Find a file called CSH1F2_2018_Session3_Class-Project.sb2 and upload it to Scratch editor with this menu : File > Upload from Your Computer
	1e Select Ball Sprite in Scratch (on the bottom left on Scratch editor screen) and solve the scrambled pieces of code (on the right side of Scratch editor screen)

2 Check the status of your repository with this : git status

3 Check the commit history in your repository with this : git log --oneline

4 Submit Class Project file (.sb file for Scratch) with these series of commands :

	4a Download Scratch stuff with this menu : File > Download to Your Computer
	4b Solve puzzles of code in Scratch editor :
		make sure you have Chrome installed and allow installation of Adobe Flash Player.
		go to https://scratch.mit.edu and select " Create " menu on top - you will enter Editor.
		you also need to register in Scratch.mit.edu homepage.
		solve the puzzles of code (Script) in Sprite " Ball ".
		dont change any Scripts in Sprite " Paddle ". 
	4c Save file as CSH1F2_2018_Session3_Class-Project_<your_student_id>.sb2    
	4d Add the file to local repository : git add CSH1F2_2018_Session3_Class-Project_<your_student_id>.sb2
	4e Commit the file to local repository : git commit CSH1F2_2018_Session3_Class-Project_<your_student_id>.sb2 –m “<your_full_name> <your_student_id>”
	4f Update your work to remote repository : git push origin <your_student_id>

5 Back to master branch in local repository : git checkout master

6 Wait for further instruction from lecturer.

After finished, please have time to learn how the code works.
It is actualy an example of event driven programming, where program is " listening " to events and responding accordingly.

Have a nice gaming ...

Bonus:

If you are learning Algorithm and Data Structures or Algorithm and Programming subject, then you can also learn from this Scratch pseudocodes:

1 visualization of sorting algorithms: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/149793697/#

2 primality testing algorithm: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/94519097/

3 string search algorithm: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/107691199/
